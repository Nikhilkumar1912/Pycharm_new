Uploading Files to Databricks

1. Using the Databricks Workspace UI
You can easily upload files to your Databricks workspace using the user interface.

Steps:
Open the Databricks Workspace: Log in to your Databricks account and navigate to the workspace.
Navigate to the Files Tab: In the sidebar, click on the "Workspace" tab or the "Data" tab.
Upload Files:
Click on the "Add Data" button or the "Upload" option (usually represented by a cloud icon).
Select the file(s) you want to upload from your local machine.
Confirm Upload: Once the upload is complete, the files will be available in the "DBFS" (Databricks File System).


2. Using Databricks CLI
You can also use the Databricks Command-Line Interface (CLI) to upload files programmatically.

Steps:
Install Databricks CLI: If not already installed, follow the Databricks CLI installation instructions.
Configure CLI: Run databricks configure --token and provide your Databricks workspace URL and access token.
Upload File: Use the following command:
bash
Copy code
databricks fs cp local_file_path dbfs:/path/in/databricks/


3. Using Notebook Commands
You can also upload files directly in a notebook using the following command:

python
Copy code
dbutils.fs.put("dbfs:/path/in/databricks/filename.txt", "file content", overwrite=True)





#Handling Corrupt Records in CSV

df_csv = spark.read.option("mode", "DROPMALFORMED").csv("dbfs:/path/to/your/directory/filename.csv")

#Specifying Delimiters For CSV files, you can specify a different delimiter

df_csv = spark.read.option("delimiter", ";").csv("dbfs:/path/to/your/directory/filename.csv")
