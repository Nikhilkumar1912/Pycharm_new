Available methods include: credentials, data, fs, jobs, library, meta, notebook, preview, secrets, widgets

This module provides various utilities for users to interact with the rest of Databricks.
credentials: DatabricksCredentialUtils -> Utilities for interacting with credentials within notebooks
data: DataUtils -> Utilities for understanding and interacting with datasets (EXPERIMENTAL)
fs: DbfsUtils -> Manipulates the Databricks filesystem (DBFS) from the console
jobs: JobsUtils -> Utilities for leveraging jobs features
library: LibraryUtils -> Utilities for session isolated libraries
meta: MetaUtils -> Methods to hook into the compiler (EXPERIMENTAL)
notebook: NotebookUtils -> Utilities for the control flow of a notebook (EXPERIMENTAL)
preview: Preview -> Utilities under preview category
secrets: SecretUtils -> Provides utilities for leveraging secrets within notebooks
widgets: WidgetsUtils -> Methods to create and get bound value of input widgets inside notebooks


dbutils.fs provides utilities for working with FileSystems. Most methods in this package can take either a DBFS path
(e.g., "/foo" or "dbfs:/foo"), or another FileSystem URI. For more info about a method, use dbutils.fs.help("methodName").
In notebooks, you can also use the %fs shorthand to access DBFS. The %fs shorthand maps straightforwardly onto dbutils calls. For example, "%fs head --maxBytes=10000 /file/path" translates into "dbutils.fs.head("/file/path", maxBytes = 10000)".
mount
mount(source: String, mountPoint: String, encryptionType: String = "", owner: String = null, extraConfigs: Map = Map.empty[String, String]): boolean -> Mounts the given source directory into DBFS at the given mount point
mounts: Seq -> Displays information about what is mounted within DBFS
refreshMounts: boolean -> Forces all machines in this cluster to refresh their mount cache, ensuring they receive the most recent information
unmount(mountPoint: String): boolean -> Deletes a DBFS mount point
updateMount(source: String, mountPoint: String, encryptionType: String = "", owner: String = null, extraConfigs: Map = Map.empty[String, String]): boolean -> Similar to mount(), but updates an existing mount point (if present) instead of creating a new one

fsutils
cp(from: String, to: String, recurse: boolean = false): boolean -> Copies a file or directory, possibly across FileSystems
head(file: String, maxBytes: int = 65536): String -> Returns up to the first 'maxBytes' bytes of the given file as a String encoded in UTF-8
ls(dir: String): Seq -> Lists the contents of a directory
mkdirs(dir: String): boolean -> Creates the given directory if it does not exist, also creating any necessary parent directories
mv(from: String, to: String, recurse: boolean = false): boolean -> Moves a file or directory, possibly across FileSystems
put(file: String, contents: String, overwrite: boolean = false): boolean -> Writes the given String out to a file, encoded in UTF-8
rm(dir: String, recurse: boolean = false): boolean -> Removes a file or directory




Implementation Steps:

Identify Key Queries: Collaborated with stakeholders to identify the most frequently used queries needed for daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports.

Script Development:

Wrote SQL scripts to automate the execution of these queries. For example, a script that aggregates daily sales data by product category and region.
Implemented scheduling tools (like cron jobs) to run these scripts at designated times without manual intervention.
Testing and Validation: Conducted thorough testing to ensure the scripts returned accurate results and handled edge cases, such as missing data.

Deployment: Deployed the scripts in the production environment, setting up alerts for any failures to ensure continuous operation.
